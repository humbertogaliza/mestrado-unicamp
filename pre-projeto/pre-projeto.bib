Internet eXchange Points have been targets since they represent a microcosm of Internet diversity. The contribution of this paper is the first empirical analysis of the IXP ecosystem in Brazil, com- piling information that comprehend the characterization of members participa- ting of these environments, including the build of AS-level connectivity graphs. By analysing the topologies we found the average adjacency of IXP’s members (vertices degree), the isolated and accumulated depth of paths in advertised routes (AS-PATH), the density of peers to highlight the peering potential within IXPs, the accounting of traffic engineering policies related to AS-Prepend and k-clique communities. Another contribution is that our dataset with more than 2.5 GB is shared with the academic community.}

  abstract = {Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are generally considered to be the successors of the four Network Access Points that were mandated as part of the decommissioning of the NSFNET in 1994/95 to fa- cilitate the transition from the NSFNET to the “public Internet” as we know it today. While this popular view does not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true is that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown to more than 300 (as of May 2013 ), with the largest IXPs
handling daily traffic volumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier-1 ISPs, but IXPs have never really attracted any attention from the networking research community. At first glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have apparently little to do with current “hot” topic areas such as data centers and cloud services or software defined networking (SDN) and mobile communication. However, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data centers and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be of great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the current and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but largely unknown sources of publicly available information about IXPs to describe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the critical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the world, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate the important role that IXPs play in to- day’s Internet ecosystem and discuss how IXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet marketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world.}

  abstract =  {Deploying software-defined networking (SDN) at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) offers new hope for solving long- standing problems in interdomain routing. SDN allows di- rect expression of more flexible policies, and IXPs are cen- tral rendezvous points that are in the midst of a rebirth, mak- ing them a natural place to start. We present the design of an SDN exchange point (SDX) that enables much more ex- pressive policies than conventional hop-by-hop, destination- based forwarding. ISPs can apply many diverse actions on packets based on multiple header fields, and distant net- works can exercise “remote control” over packet handling. This flexibility enables applications such as inbound traf- fic engineering, redirection of traffic to middleboxes, wide- area server load balancing, and blocking of unwanted traf- fic. Supporting these applications requires effective ways to combine the policies of multiple ISPs. Our SDX controller provides each ISP the abstraction of its own virtual switch and sequentially composes the policies of different ISPs into a single set of rules in the physical switches. Preliminary ex- periments on our operational SDX demonstrate the potential for changing interdomain routing from the inside out.},

  abstract = {Software-Defined Internet Exchange Points (SDXes) promise to significantly increase the flexibility and func- tion of interdomain traffic delivery on the Internet. Unfor- tunately, current SDX designs cannot yet achieve the scale required for large Internet exchange points (IXPs), which can host hundreds of participants exchanging traffic for hundreds of thousands of prefixes. Existing platforms are indeed too slow and inefficient to operate at this scale, typ- ically requiring minutes to compile policies and millions of forwarding rules in the data plane.
We motivate, design, and implement iSDX, the first SDX architecture that can operate at the scale of the largest IXPs. We show that iSDX reduces both policy compilation time and forwarding table size by two orders of magnitude compared to current state-of-the-art SDX controllers. Our evaluation against a trace from one of the largest IXPs in the world found that iSDX can compile a realistic set of policies for 500 IXP participants in less than three seconds. Our public release of iSDX, complete with tutorials and documentation, is already spurring early adoption in operational networks.}

Provisioning circuits, maintaining a loop-free network topology, and configuring multipath redundancy to provide high availability are complex processes, which involve extensive coordination between, and manual configuration operations carried out by, multiple network operators, resulting in high operations costs. Moreover, network-oriented research applications increasingly require the capability to program network functions to satisfy particular requirements, such as high tolerance, low delay, end-to-end visibility, etc. We describe a solution, based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which significantly lowers the operations costs by automating most network operations and reducing coordination efforts between network operators. The design of the network, before and after SDN was deployed, is discussed. For each network function migrated to SDN, a comparative analysis is provided with metrics, first to represent real measurements before and after each SDN deployment scenario, and second, to describe findings of reduced operations costs.}

This paper then reports the work that has been done to migrate the TouIX IXP located in Toulouse (France) from a traditional to a full OpenFlow IXP. It especially describes how switches have been selected, configured and installed, and presents the management tools that have been developed, together with performance and service measurements and evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, from may 2015, TouSIX (the SDN evolution of TouIX) is the first Internet Exchange Provider in Europe to fully leverage OpenFlow for its day-to-day operations.}

This service has greatly simplified inter-domain routing for those members and has made it easy for them to peer with possibly hundreds of networks at those IXPs from the get-go.
In this paper, we report on an empirical analysis that is based on a unique collection of IXP-provided datasets from two different European IXPs that operate a route server and gave us access to a wealth of route server-specific BGP data. Both IXPs also made the traffic datasets that they routinely collect from their public switch- ing infrastructures available to us. Using this information, we per- form a first-of-its-kind study that correlates a detailed control plane view with a rich data plane view to reason about the different peer- ing options available at these IXPs and how some of the major In- ternet players make use of them. In the process, we highlight the important role that the IXPs’ route servers play for inter-domain routing in today’s Internet and demonstrate the benefits of studying IXP peerings in a manner that is not agnostic but fully aware of traffic. We conclude with a discussion of some of the ramifications of our findings for both network researchers and operators.}

However, questions remain over the operation of such systems in production environments. In order to explore the challenges of hybrid SDN systems and build operational confidence, we built a simple distributed router using OpenFlow and deployed it at a public Internet exchange. This implementation provides insights into the challenges involved with using these technologies, and sug- gests the viability of mixed device environments despite the limitations of early OpenFlow implementations.}
